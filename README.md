## How it works
Let's explore how the app works a little. First off, `pd run start.md` will boot up the command line interface.

[[start]] will set the initial action, clear the screen neatly, and the user into [[mainLoop]].

[[mainLoop]] is a simple delegator. After each action a Cliffy `Input` prompt will pause the loop and wait for the next instruction. So far you can only:

Log all Deno.Kv data associated with Pipedown projects on your system: [[fetchAndTrackLatest]]
